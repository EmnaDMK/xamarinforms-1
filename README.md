# On The Fence with Xamarin.Forms
Source Code for the examples and projects at http://xamarin.onthefencedevelopment.com 

This repo will (ultimately) contain source code for the examples and projects on my blog 'On The Fence with Xamarin.Forms). Remember that the Xamarin.Forms technology is a moving platform and that as it evolves some code maybe deprecated, i.e. something that runs fine in v2.0 may not run at all in v4.0 (sometime in the future). I will include details of the versions of the components used with each solution to aid with any problems you may encounter.

I intend to include the PDF of the actual blog post with each solution that it relates to (we'll see how that goes).
