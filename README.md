# On The Fence with Xamarin.Forms

This repo will (ultimately) contain source code for examples and projects following my journey into the world of Xamarin.Forms. My blog at http://www.onthefencedevelopment.com/blog/ will contain the background for each sample/project.

Remember that the Xamarin.Forms technology is a moving platform and that as it evolves some code maybe deprecated, i.e. something that runs fine in v2.0 may not run at all in v4.0 (sometime in the future). I will include details of the versions of the components used with each solution to aid with any problems you may encounter.

I intend to include the PDF of the actual blog post with each solution that it relates to (we'll see how that goes).
